# gformMail

Google Forms are used to gathering information from participants in Geomundus Conference. As Google offers a basic notification service, this year (2019), we wanted to implement a template in Google Forms.

Even though there are some plugins, the cost for using them are not considered in the conference budget. Therefore, implementing the code was the best solution: unlimited mail notifications, custom design, and non-third parties handling the data.

The script implements 2 files: .gs (Google Script) and HTML (Template)

## Google Script
Form Spreedsheet data recovered and implemented to show to the user.

## Template
HTML editior will be needed. A first template can be found.

## TODO
Change the domain from the notification email service, aka @gmail for the @geomundus.
